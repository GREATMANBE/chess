if someone forfeits on time, bughousedb.org seems to record whatever their prior move was at time 0
to be the move at top zero, with comment that they lost on time ....

notice here that move 35a is repeated

35A. Rd2{0.385} 35a. B@g4+{57.392} 29b. Kb8{62.265} 30B. Qxd8+{18.241} 35a. B@g4+{57.392} {Conquerer forfeits on time} 0-1
